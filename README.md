# SwiftTermApp

SwiftTermApp is a terminal emulator and SSH client application for iOS
using the [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm) engine and written in SwiftUI.

Some of the features:
* Comprehensive terminal emulator, based on SwiftTerm - which is both very comprehensive in terms of emulation, 
  and has extensive support for international terminals, both for generated output as well as the support for
  iOS input methods for dictation and international input.
* Supports for keys stored on the secure enclave, so your private key can never be found in plain text.
* Themable user interface:
  * Using the user interface provided or
  * Programatically, through the terminal support for configuring colors dynamically.
* Metal shaders for some cool live effects
